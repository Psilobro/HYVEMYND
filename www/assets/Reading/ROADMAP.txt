üß† Hive Tactics AI Integration Roadmap
Phase 1: Foundation & Rules Fidelity
Goal: Ensure the AI knows all bug movement, placement, and game rules perfectly.

1.1 Bug Movement Module

Refactor/extend move generators for each bug (Queen, Beetle, Ant, Spider, Grasshopper, Mosquito, Ladybug, Pillbug).
Add edge-case handling (e.g., Beetle climbing, Mosquito mimicking, Ladybug‚Äôs 3-step, Pillbug‚Äôs special ability).
File: js/ai-bug-moves.js
1.2 Placement Rules Module

Enforce all placement rules (adjacency, no enemy contact, first move exceptions, Queen placement deadlines).
File: js/ai-placement-rules.js
1.3 Game State & Notation

Add support for Hive notation and position tracking for game review and AI learning.
File: js/ai-notation.js
Phase 2: Strategic Evaluation & Heuristics
Goal: Teach the AI to evaluate positions using the book‚Äôs strategic principles.

2.1 Heuristic Evaluation Engine

Implement scoring for Mobility, Tempo, Strength (the ‚Äúthree keys to victory‚Äù).
Add phase-aware heuristics (opening, midgame, endgame).
File: js/ai-eval.js
2.2 Tactical Pattern Recognition

Detect and score for Pins, Covers, Blocks, Fills, Double Pins, Shutouts, Squeezes, Rings, Elbows, Pockets.
File: js/ai-tactics.js
2.3 Formation Detection

Recognize and evaluate Gates, Doors, Rings, Elbows, Pockets.
File: js/ai-formations.js
Phase 3: Advanced Tactics & Counterplay
Goal: Integrate advanced tactics and counter-tactics from the book.

3.1 Counterattack Logic

Implement logic for switching between attack and defense, recognizing momentum shifts.
File: js/ai-counterattack.js
3.2 Bug Counting & Resource Management

Track bug counts, reserves, and attack/defense force for both sides.
File: js/ai-bug-count.js
3.3 Draw Detection & Play-for-Draw

Recognize and play for draws (stretched hive, compact queens, forced repetition).
File: js/ai-draws.js
Phase 4: Opening, Midgame, Endgame Theory
Goal: Make the AI phase-aware and able to follow book openings and transitions.

4.1 Opening Book Integration

Add opening move databases and heuristics for White/Black.
File: js/ai-opening-book.js
4.2 Midgame Transition Logic

Adjust priorities for bug placement, attack, defense, and tactical patterns.
File: js/ai-phase.js
4.3 Endgame Solver

Implement bug counting, fill tactics, and optimal closing strategies.
File: js/ai-endgame.js
Phase 5: Mistake Avoidance & Human-Like Play
Goal: Avoid beginner mistakes and exploit human errors.

5.1 Mistake Database

Encode common mistakes (misusing ants, poor bug placement, failing to defend queen, wasting tempo).
File: js/ai-mistakes.js
5.2 Adaptive Play

Track opponent tendencies and adapt strategy (psychology in the Hive).
File: js/ai-adapt.js
Phase 6: Learning, Review, and Self-Improvement
Goal: Enable the AI to learn from games and improve over time.

6.1 Game Logging & Review

Log games in Hive notation for replay and analysis.
File: js/ai-review.js
6.2 Self-Training Harness

Allow AI to play against itself, review games, and adjust weights.
File: js/ai-selftrain.js
Phase 7: UI & Personality Integration
Goal: Make it easy to adjust AI strength and personality.

7.1 Personality Profiles

Use the same engine for Sunny, Buzzwell, Beedric; adjust depth, iterations, and aggression/defense weights.
File: js/ai-personality.js
7.2 Dev Ops Controls

Add UI controls for AI depth, style, and review.
File: Extend dev-ops.js and ai-ui.js
Phase 8: Testing & Validation
Goal: Ensure correctness and strength.

8.1 Node Harnesses

Extend test_spider.js and add new tests for each bug, tactic, and formation.
File: test_tactics.js, test_formations.js, etc.
8.2 Game Simulation

Simulate games against previous engine versions and human logs.

üóÇÔ∏è How to Tackle the Roadmap
Start with bug movement and placement modules (Phase 1)
Add strategic evaluation and tactical pattern modules (Phase 2)
Integrate advanced tactics and counterplay (Phase 3)
Implement phase-aware logic and opening/endgame theory (Phase 4)
Add mistake avoidance and adaptive play (Phase 5)
Enable game review and self-training (Phase 6)
Integrate personality controls and UI (Phase 7)
Test and validate with harnesses and simulations (Phase 8)
‚úÖ Result
Your v2 engine will play with deep knowledge of Hive Tactics.txt.
All personalities (Sunny, Buzzwell, Beedric) use the same engine, just with different parameters.
The AI will recognize and use every tactic, formation, and strategic principle from the book.
You‚Äôll have a modular, maintainable codebase that‚Äôs easy to extend and debug.
